# Visual Nuts Exercises
Little spring boot project, just to make some exercises

Obs.: It's a very simple spring boot project. I decided to use spring boot just because of Excercise One, that needed test cases, in order to demonstrate how to keep the code safe from future updates with possible bugs.

Obs2.: In the Exercise Two, I could have reuse some slices of code, extracting them to some methodes and reusing them. But to this example I decided to implement each one with their one logic separately, as each one may be complete different logics

## How to run
You'll need Maven and java 11+  configured in your machine.
Then run the command below:
```
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the project and run all tests inside the project.

Obs.: All the exercises are being executed and demonstrated by the test classes. After you compile the project, you can run each test individually in your preferred IDE.
