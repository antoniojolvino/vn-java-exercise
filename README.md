# Visual Nuts Exercises
Little spring boot project, just to make some exercises

Obs.: It's a very simple spring boot project. I decided to use spring boot just because of Excercise One, that needed test cases, in order to demonstrate how to keep the code safe from future updates with possible bugs.

## How to run
You'll need Maven and java 11+  configured in your machine.
Then run the command below:
```
mvn clean install
```

This command will compile the project and run all tests inside the project.

Obs.: All the exercises are being executed and demonstrated by the test classes. After you compile the project, you can run each test individually in your preferred IDE.
